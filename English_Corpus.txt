Weird how I never felt like I needed guns for protection until Obama was elected...just thinking out loud...#guncontrol #Obama #NRA
Why do these morons think Obama is Muslim? The U.S. would never elect a Muslim president due to that very kind of moronic thinking.
#Obama seeks to empower muslims-most never read koran=MOST SLAMIC TERRORIST LEADERS from elite families+R well versed in koran PHDs
Scott Walker never finished college. Can say "islamic terrorism". Barack Obama went to law school. Cannot say "islamic terrorism".

Yet Obama received one for peace!  Albert Einstein never received a Nobel Prize for his theory of relativity.
@Wh1t3Rabbit @DmitriCyber like I tweeted to @RedDragon1949... Obama did call "no backsies" when they promised.
Two things: Obama was going to talk to despots. That failed. He never tried. And after 5 years of dissing Congress, he needs them.
I love how John McCain and Lindsay Graham never liked Barack Obama. Now, with the Syria situation, it seems they are in bed with him.
Obama talked of combatting climate change. The US never ratified the Kyoto Protocol.  #obamainberlin
@SirJosephMc Yea and Obama never disbanded his political campaign after 2008 and had it running for for years for 2012.
@MinnesotaDFL Obama never turns down a chance for Oprah either... Ellison on TV? Those who throw stones....

@markos Between Obama  tie, 53% think Romney didn't win. Besides, we'll never reach that other 47%
"I have never seen the media so biased for Obama than they are now" - Fox News.
Obama thought Muslims would love him for his heritage but never realized he'd betrayed them by becoming U.S. President.  #obama2012
@BigJebBos @markos Wow. Never seen that before? Remember when #Obama's TelePrompTer went to fast and he told them to back it up. .

@Isliee1 @ConservCandy1 - Obama refers to himself as "a constitutional law professor" that's ironic since he uses it like toilet paper.

@juliethecat Totally. I don't understand why people don't get that. Even Obama has never surrounded himself with that.

#nerdland hard not to see Sam I Am as Obama, green eggs and ham as the Affordable Care Act, Cruz as intransigent narrator
@realDonaldTrump According to the left, being a Muslim is NOT a BAD thing. So why get ruffled that someone called Obama a Muslim?  üòíObama, Cameron, Hollande, Merkel are all presiding over regimes that do not reflect the interests of their people. Brave new world.
The US needs Israel's nod at not just policy formation reg Palestine but also issuance of statements. And then Obama also wins #Nobel

@FoxNews Obama will not say muslim extremest in fear of empowering them but will cry Fox News validating their news worthiness.
@DRUDGE_REPORT Josh Earnest must not know Obama had no issue calling Bush unpatriotic.

@JuliaDavisNews never thought we'd ever tout Putin as diplomatic.
So, #Putin signs anti-gay law, promises to never extradict #Snowden. Clearly, those are connected
Why are people sharing pictures of Vladamir Putin on facebook... like he is some sort of hero... do they not realise what he's done

#Trump just said if #Romney had put it more effort in 2012, we wouldn't be in the mess we're in now. He's not wrong there.
is when the #GOP has #Trump pledge not to run as a 3rd party cand., but when he gets the nom, they scramble to find a 3rd party cand.
@robertliefeld @aravosis it's funny that in the first debate Trump was asked not to run as a third party when someone else wins.
Saudi politician: Trump presidency would be "catastrophic" and set the world back "not just generations, but centuries."  #7thCentury

Mystery of the year: how come Obama's "dentists, farmers, teachers and students" are beating the Assad army? what happened?

@ByronYork Establishment GOP attacking Trump for not being conservative while supporting Boehner's 4 Trillion debt while Speaker.
Democrats mock Donald Trump for his supposed ignorance. As if their village idiot Vice President is not a national embarrassment.

People like Ben Carson and Trump knowingly or not give legitimacy and excuses for the motives behind the terrorists.

I'm not a fan of Megan Kelly, but  is when #Trump calls ANYONE ELSE "unprofessional".
Obama born in Hawaii! His father MalcolmX an American citizen. Donald Trump was born in SouthAfrica His father NOT an American!
Donald Trump's lawyer believes a man can force himself on his wife and "by definition, it's not rape." I doubt they disagree.

@d_h_o_l_e Gun control. Obama hate. Some skinhead fuckstick hanging out of a red Durango waving a confederate flag (ironic, in Oregon), etc

Rupert Murdoch says #Obama is not a 'real black president'? Ironic when most people don't see Rupert Murdoch as a 'real human being'.
In that @politico piece, I find the quote about opponents of Obama's plan of action seemingly wanting Obama to be more like Putin ironic.
Obama gave the Middle East to #Russia and #Iran... Not bad for a two bit community organizer from Chicago!!  @ABC @CBSNews @NBCNews
Weird how I never felt like I needed guns for protection until Obama was elected...just thinking out loud...#guncontrol #Obama #NRA
Fact Finding mission ordered in US bombing of Hospital; Obama sending as many Christians as possible.

There are precious few in #Egypt who have stood for fundamental rights, without partisanship. @HossamBahgat is one such person. Free him.
Pretty ironic that Obama's own Chicago has the highest gun deaths from illegal guns in a city with a gun ban. So much for that theory. #2A
@FoxNews @LisWiehl ironic that Obama's hometown has the highest murder rate in the country. And he supports black lives matter...
Barack Obama, the first Nobel Peace Prize winner to bomb another Nobel Peace Prize winner.

Is it ironic that #Obama demands gun control for the rare mass shooting but can kill thousands of civilians via drones war on "terrorism"
"Specifically, precisely, what exactly would you do" -Obama on Syria Ironic since that's what normal folks ask gun grabbers re: #UCCShooting
Few Muslims in Egypt (24%), Turkey (18%), Israel (16%) and Jordan (15%) say suicide bombing is often or sometimes justified.
Immediately after stating following #Snowden, twitter suggested I follow Obama, Clinton  Dry cleaning how ironic... ‚Ä¶ Without Snowden, how‚Ä¶
@tonomics also I thought ironic that our friend was so pro stimulus with Obama while forgetting Bush actually did it first.
Ironic Obama criticises Russia but then bombs a hospital and the USA military call it collateral damage. Shame on them!
It's ironic that Obama, surrounded by ARMED secret service, wants to complicate gun rights for average citizens. Disarm yourself first, sir.
@GaetaSusan @minnamyself I found it ironic last week when Boehner used that term. Obama needs to go back to the middle east and stay there.
@BlissTabitha it's ironic that Obama rants on and on about targets Russia is hitting, then obama blows up a hospital with friendly's in it.
@TeaPainUSA @RandallKraft Ironic, Hitler was right wing, so today's right wing (that still thinks a lot like Hitler) tries to slur Obama.
@LiberalPhenom Funny  ironic to hear all these right wing Putin admirers whine about Obama being dictator :-) @ByronYork #stupidparty

It seems ironic now that Obama was given Nobel Prize for Peace at start of his tenure.It seems fit to take it back from him before he leaves
Wanna bet the gun stores are packed tomorrow? Obama is gun salesman of the decade. Kinda ironic really. #NRA  #2A #gunsense #UCCShooting
It's ironic that the people who can't drive usually have an Obama sticker on their car
@TheJuanWilliams Ironic that #Obama's home town Chicago has the strictest gun laws  yet has the highest rate of gun violence #TheFive
Always ironic to listen to Obama on debt ceiling. 9 years ago as a Senator he voted against raising the debt ceiling.
#YesImAChristian prayers to the victims. Ironic that President Obama can mention Trayvon Martin, bomb clock kid but not Veteran Chris Mintz!
@DWStweets How Ironic over 100 more gun deaths in Chicago in last few weeks and their been no mention or outrage from Obama or Dem party?
Ironic isn't it, that America would be lead at this critical juncture in history, by such incompetent, unpatriotic fools as Obama  Kerry!
Obama wants to take guns away from Americans, but same time giving guns to rebels in Syria to fight against their government #2A

He left the Peshmerga and joined the YPG after seeing Daesh were no longer making big attacks on the Peshmerga.
Lahur Talabani: Various Kurdish security/intel groups have not done a good enough job of coordination in Daesh fight.
Pesh official "no daesh fighter captured by peshmerga has been killed or tortured". unfortunately, kurds are too kind.
@Askari_H @SenRehmanMalik I still remember when no one was ready to name Daesh he again came forward and exposed daesh nexus in Pakistan
I bet this Egyptian who robbed #Daesh in #Syria will resurface many years later as a "counter-terrorism expert."  #IS @hxhassan
@justinbieber I know its not true but I believe each and every word you say...te amo‚ô•
@AhmetRifatAlbuz Daesh is also made by Armenians, Al-Qaeda also  stop spreading hate towards Armenians. Turkey made indirectly PKK.
@Tonyblair_TBFF @tonyblairoffice @sjfeuer Old TB played a crucial role in destabilising the ME thus facilitating the rise of DAESH
@freeiraqii @atefahmed69  #ISIS and #Daesh did this. Those dead suffered from #Islamophobia, and were cured by death.
@MarcACaputo Rubio should apologize for not being born a Bush, or for not having his dad give him a small loan of a $1 Milli.
Chances are that Cheney,  even W, would love 2B out of the country bec of Bush the elder's book. But they can't. They'd be arrested.
@Wonkette I'm beginning to think the Bush boys are establishing a bad track record when it somes to strategery!
@JohnDennisWEEI and Bush was an awesome speaker.
Some of PMB's reply were no-nonsense, and frank. No beating around the bush sentences. No ramblings. I loved that.
Jeb bush is toast, America will never butter another bush

Ahhhh, another sjiite who supports Bashar Al Kalb, boy what a surprise.  @wildquester
@imagodei1333 Yesterday was Bashar al-Assad's birthday. Bummer for him. #assad #tragedy
Does taking chemical weapons away from Bashar mean he is still allowed to murder innocent ppl using other weapons?
According to the Plain Dealer, it's Bashar al-Assad's birthday. I bet the whole country's celebrating!  #Syria
If you can't trust Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin, who can you trust? #Syria
u forgot  tag.  If chemical weapons were used on the people of Syria, let's bomb the fuck out of Syria to teach Bashar..
#HandsoffSyria so that Bashar can keep his #HandsonSyria...  #Act2EndAssadsWar
@JoeMoger I know of no AFC Wimbledon fan who does claim that their club is the Crazy Gang.
Bashar al-Assad: "If you [bomb] me do I not bleed?" From Shakespeare's "Shylock", a Jewish character.  or just manipulative?
Huh. I didn't know bashar al-Assad's bday is September 11...
I expect a new WH announcement soon to alleviate the suffering of #syria "executive order to shut down Bashar's instagram account"
We shouldn't sleep. We should br dedicated tweeters to spreading Anti Bashar hate.
Morsi fell before Bashar.  #Syria @fsa_media_hub
-Is It with N or L? Let me check... -It's with RRR!!!! Hahaahahh I'll never forget that Bashar Al-Assad is with R!
Saudi position had not changed. "There has to be certainty that Bashar al-Assad will leave" #Syria
@Thalwen I'm not sure to be happy or sad. Russia is a thorn for Israel, awesome but they support Bashar. Not so awesome.
